title: Advanced charts and the need for Chartstack.Model.groupBy()
---

If you've read the Chartstack [Unified Chart Data Format Wiki page](https://github.com/keenlabs/chartstack/wiki/Unified-Chart-Data-Format) you'll note that all chart data is a time series and can generally be described in one of the four main data types (which are all subsets and supersets of each other): Metric, Multi Metric, Time Series, and Multi Time Series. These data formats cover a surprisingly high number of chart types from pie, bar, line, multi-bar/line, scatter, etc.

For brevity, here is what Multi Time Series data looks like:

{% highlight js %}
{
  "data": [
    ["Year", "Sales", "Expenses"],
    ["2004",  1000,      400],
    ["2005",  1170,      460],
    ["2006",  660,       1120],
    ["2007",  1030,      540]
  ],
   "extras": {}
]
{% endhighlight %}

To repeat, all chart data, whether the end product is a pie chart or multi-scatter chart can be represented using this data schema or a subset of this schema. Until we encountered this kind of chart:
